This is the front end and back end server of Kanap an e-commerce website

### Back end Prerequisites ###

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

# TO RUN :

- 1. Clone this repo.

- 2. From the "back" folder of the project, run `npm install`.

- 3. You can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
